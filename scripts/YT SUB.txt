9th Life
@9thlife308•145 subscribers
If it's true that curiosity killed the cat, then I'd rather be a cat on its last life. On 9th Life, I share what I think is wonderful about the universe, both real and otherwise. I do this using science and math, in the form of stories and puzzles. I truly believe that science and math can be wonderful works of art. A bit about me: I am currently a grad student who learns and implements programming, math, and physics to try and solve problems in biology. I've very recently discovered that for all our advances at the cutting edge of science, the teaching of it is grossly undervalued. And so is the wisdom of retrospect, of filling in the gaps of understanding the basics, which we all accumulate.

Hi I'm Dr. Nathan Dalaklis. This channel has been a great goal accountability tool for me to learn or keep up with certain skills over the years. At the time of writing the channel is pivoting towards a new skill I want to devote more time to learning. Here are somethings I have used this channel for in the past: As a PhD student, I primarily posted reflections about graduate school, The PhD process, and some math explainers to work on becoming a better mathematical speaker and keep my goal of completing my PhD in mind and the different milestones along the way. Before graduate school, my videos were primarily "mathematics with chalk" and they kept me engaged with math prior to my graduate work. In those chalk math talks, I went through things that I find interesting in mathematics, whether they be proofs, algorithms, or maybe a look at some higher math concepts. The channel got its name from the fact that I've always been a fan of chalkboards. Thanks for watching!

Cheenta Academy for Olympiad & Research
@Cheenta•79.2k subscribers
Visit http://cheenta.com/ Since 2010, August, we have worked with hundreds of outstanding students from over five countries. Some of these students went on to perform brilliantly in Math Olympiads and other challenging mathematical contests. All credit goes to their years of hard work and persistence. Time and again, we learnt outstanding problem-solving strategies from our students. We follow pedagogical methods used in the erstwhile Soviet Union. Discussions begin and end with problems. Students tirelessly work together on different methods. Faculty, on the other hand, disrupts this group-work with occasional hints and conceptual remarks, almost never divulging the entire solution. This method was crafted under the brilliant leadership of Vasiliyev in Mathematical Circles of Moscow and Saint Petersburg.

So many people have had a negative experience learning chemistry, and I hope to provide a way for people to have a positive and engaging experience learning science through the videos I create. As a high school chemistry teacher, I try to make videos that reveal how chemistry applies to real life. This ends up taking many forms; sometimes explaining the chemistry behind how things work, or a historical perspective, always through the lens of science. I've been a chemistry teacher for more than two decades, and have my BS in Chemistry as well as a MS in Learning Design. I've taught in both public and private schools. My mantra is "Stay curious.

Dead Sound
@DeadSound•1.16m subscribers
About me: My name is David James Armsby. I was born in May 1996, in Scotland. I was homeschooled and spent all my teen years inside, learning new skills and working on elaborate projects. This is when I learned to animate, draw, paint, sculpt, make films, etc. All my animation and film-making skills are self-taught. I started animating in 2012, and through a monumental amount of trial and error; I managed to learn how to create original films on my own. I went to study 'Art and Design' at my local college in 2015 covering fine art, still life, basic drawing skills, and sculpture. I had to start at the bottom of the academic ladder because of my lack of formal qualifications. I was far beyond what they were teaching, but I was going more so for the social and life experience. The one thing college taught me was the importance of sketchbooks, which has since become a huge part of my creative process. I left college in 2019 and have since made Youtube/Patreon my full-time job.

Everyday Astronaut
@EverydayAstronaut•1.91m subscribers
Rocket science. A term we all use to describe something incredibly difficult. Trying to grasp all of the concepts involved in rocket science can be incredibly intimidating. My name’s Tim Dodd but I'm better known as the Everyday Astronaut. Recently I fell head over heels in love with spaceflight. My appreciation and curiosity for the subject grew into an obsession. Before you knew it, all I wanted to do was learn more and more... the more I learned, the more I wanted to share what was making me so excited. But as someone who dropped out of college and has no technical background or degree… I really felt unqualified for the job of explaining rocket science to anyone. But the fact of the matter is, if I can learn this stuff, anyone can. Rocket science is awesome, and you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to be excited. Everyday Astronaut.

Forest Film Studio
@forestfilmstudio•107k subscribers
Welcome to the website where we present films and recordings made by filmmakers from the Polish State Forests. Poland takes the leading position in Europe as far as the forest area is concerned. The forests overgrow 9.1 million hectares which is 29.4% of the territory of Poland. The vast majority of this area are forests owned by the state, out of which almost 7.6 million hectares are under the State Forests Holding management. The Forest Film Studio is part of it. We want to share with you the effects of our work, i.e. unusual film meetings with nature, and in particular with the forest. In the photos you will see many animals filmed in their natural habitat, you will see the wildest corners of Poland, captivating landscapes. We hope that the films posted here, made in Forest Film Studio, will inspire you to your own natural explorations. We will be very grateful if you subscribe to the channel and leave an opinion about the movies you watched.

The "How Do They Know" show from journalists Adam Cole and Joss Fong. You may have seen our work with Vox, NPR's Skunk Bear, and Netflix "Explained". Now we've left those jobs and work directly for you. These are our principles: Curiosity-driven: We are not searching for evidence to support a position that we've already chosen. We are here to understand what it takes to answer interesting questions and to help you navigate what we know so far. Primary sources: We read all of the research that we cover, and we interview those involved in that work (Researchers: please answer our emails!) Accountability: In the case of any factual errors, we will post corrections directly under the relevant video that explain what we got wrong. Independence: Outside of shorts, we will not accept offers for spon-con/native advertising, in which the video itself exists to serve the sponsor. The ad read is the only part of the video that sponsors review. To support this project, find us on Patreon.

Welcome to my Channel. I try to do researched content about various topics ranging from history, anthropology, geography, culture and more and more and more. I have a long list, and yeah I actually have a list of videos that I want to make in the future. I constantly update that list and post it in the community tab monthly. My patreons then vote on which topic comes next. The process by which I currently work is to make a short video (about 12-30 minutes long) followed by a long video (about 1-2 hours long) and to try to do two videos a month. I hope you enjoy what I have made if you want to leave feedback or criticism and you want me to see it, there is a feedback tab on my discord server where I read and take note on what my audience believes should be changed,or what I got wrong, or take suggestions for topics. If you want to suggest a topic, leave feedback or support me via paypal or patreon, the links are below. If you want to contact me in person the best way is through discord.

Do you want to know how our legal system works? You’ve come to the right place. LegalEagle is all about giving you an insider’s view to the legal system. Have some fun and learn to think like a lawyer. I get asked a lot about whether being a practicing attorney is like being a lawyer on TV. I love watching legal movies and courtroom dramas. It's one of the reasons I decided to become a lawyer. But sometimes they make me want to pull my hair out because they are ridiculous. So I created this channel to answer your burning questions about the law and the legal profession. While all legal movies and shows take dramatic license to make things more interesting (nobody wants to see hundreds of hours of brief writing), many of them have a grain of truth. Learn everything you always wanted to know about being an attorney!

I also cover the rise and fall of several interesting companies and services that we come across on a day-to-day basis. There have been so many companies that have risen to fame and then died out in a single generation. The most interesting companies are the ones that were able to save themselves and avoid bankruptcy.

Mathematical Visual Proofs

I animate and provide some explanation for classic and newer "proofs without words," which are typically diagrams without any words that indicate how a theorem could be proved. I often pay homage to Proofs Without Words by including some animations without narration (only dramatic music :) ). I have also noticed that while there are many wonderful visual proofs available on YouTube, most of the creators do not credit the original visual proofs. I will do my best to include links and citations for each visual proof so that you can track down the original static images, which have a beauty and a wonder all their own. I create my animations using the amazing software Manimgl from 3Blue1Brown. If you want to buy me a coffee, you can do that here: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/VisualProofs

Hello my name is Michael. I’ve always had this curiosity of wanting to understand how things innately came about. When I heard that mathematics had a lot to do with where we are today as a civilization, I was drawn to it and perplexed. “How is it possible that math can get us to the point we are now?” I began to read about the history of mathematics from the time of Pythagoras to Newton. I began to do more mathematics. The more I did math the more curious I got. I wanted to know where the formulas came from; I wanted to get an intuitive understanding of how it all worked. Ultimately I wanted to know, “What is mathematics?” And that’s why I got my degree in math. I’m still going through my journey of discovering more, but I also like sharing what I’ve learned. I’ve made these animated videos while I was in college to inspire others to understand math. I am currently in my third year of teaching Algebra 2. FAQ: "What software do you use?" I use adobe flash, maya and imovie

Welcome to my channel 'Mechanical Engineering'. 🔥 For Business Purpose: armechanical29@gmail.com In this channel you will find some videos on new curriculum book of class 6,7,8,9 চ্যানেলের এই নামের জন্য কেউ বিভ্রান্ত হয়ে থাকলে আমি খুবই দুঃখিত। আমার এই চ্যানেলটি আজ থেকে চার বছর আগে তৈরি করা। চ্যানেলে আগে মেকানিক্যাল ইঞ্জিনিয়ারিং রিলেটেড ভিডিও গুলো দেয়া হত। পরবর্তীতে ভিডিওর কনটেন্ট ক্যাটাগরি পরিবর্তন করার পর নামটা আর পরিবর্তন করা হয়ে ওঠেনি। ইতিমধ্যে ছোটখাটো একটা ফ্যানবেইজ তৈরি হয়ে গিয়েছে যাদের কাছে আমার এই চ্যানেলটি এই নামেই পরিচিত। তাই আমি চাইলেও আর এই মুহূর্তে নামটা পরিবর্তন করা সম্ভব না। নামের এ বিষয়টি নিয়ে আমি নিজেও কিছুটা ইতস্তত বোধ করি, কিন্তু আমার কিছু করার নেই আসলে। Related Keywords: Mechanical Engineering Class 6 Mechanical Engineering Class 7 Mechanical Engineering Class 8 Mechanical Engineering Class 9 I hope you will be benefited by this channel. Finally, Thanks everyone. 🔥 1M Subscribers — 29.05.2024 🔥 1.5 Subscribers - 29.11.2024

My goal is to help there be less late nights, tears, and frustration associated with math homework. Why am I called the Midnight Math Tutor? Well, I figure a lot of math homework is done late at night. And, with three little kiddos of my own, a lot of times I'm filming these...around midnight. Along with the math you'll receive some corny jokes and hear me laughing at myself...because I think I'm hilarious #yourewelcome. But sincerely, I put time and a lot of thought into organizing and linking my videos in a way I hope will best serve you in getting your math homework done. If you have a specific question or problem, feel free to leave a comment, or send me an email at midnightmathtutor@gmail.com Thanks for stopping by.

Morphocular
@morphocular•170k subscribers
The name rhymes with "binocular", and it's a channel intended to teach math with the help of visuals and animation wherever possible. Henri Poincaré once said about mathematicians, "Matter does not engage their attention, they are interested in form alone." And in one sense, math can be defined as the study of pure form ("morphḗ"). This channel is meant to be a morphocular, a lens on math, that clarifies and illuminates its often confusing and daunting concepts to reveal the beautiful thing it really is. I hope this channel lets a little of that beauty shine through to you. Note about business inquiries: The channel is currently in a less active state for the time being and so I have less energy to investigate sponsorship opportunities. Inquiries are still welcome, but I may not respond.

Capturing the natural beauty of chemistry I find that chemistry is often taught poorly or without a purpose. Because of this, people tend to lose interest and sometimes even start to hate it. In each video that I make, I try to balance theory with purpose. My goal is to capture the natural beauty of chemistry in fun and interesting ways. In terms of education, I have a BSc in Biochemistry, with a minor in pharmacology. However, I've always been a lot more drawn to applied chemistry. So after finishing my degree, I worked as a lab tech in an organic lab, and then as a chemistry grad student. However, I ended up leaving my graduate studies early to focus on this channel.

Physics is the most fundamental science which explains the universe. No small task, right? Sometimes it seems a little daunting, but I think you can do it! And I'm pleased to offer a little companionship along the way. This channel contains 29 Modules covering the physics you'll see in high school AP Physics or introductory physics in college. First Semester Mechanics: Modules 1-15. Second Semester E&M: Modules 16-29. Thank you to all my Fandersons (TM) out there! For you, I am revamping this channel to include all my squeak-free videos in a much more organized format. (I know, those squeaks were brutal.) Hopefully you'll enjoy it. There is also a donate link above, which will go to my kids' college fund and various charities. It's totally voluntary, but much appreciated. Cheers, Dr. A

PiXimperfect
@PiXimperfect•5.43m subscribers
PiXimperfect, hosted by Unmesh Dinda, is a free resource for learning Photoshop and Lightroom. We believe in learning the concept, rather than learning the steps so that you can translate "your" imagination visually to the world. This will make you a better decision-maker, rather than letting others make decisions for you. Since every situation is different and the definition of "beauty" is subjective, it is essential that you master the approach, and then the steps will automatically follow. Our motto is "Keep Creating." We always say to our students: "Don't worry so much about the quality, because time will improve it. Don't spend so much time getting things pixel-perfect, so that you end up not finishing it. Just 'Keep Creating,' and your consistency will take care of the rest."

Powerhouse of the Cell
@PowerhouseCell•16.3k subscribers
Powerhouse of the Cell (formerly Primo Science) aims to achieve two goals: 1) To teach science though animations: From my 5+ years of tutoring high school students, I found that it was often challenging to visualize biological and chemical processes through a textbook or blackboard. Powerhouse serves to create a visual resource for students and educators to use to facilitate learning and improve performance. 2) To teach science through experimentation: After doing research in college, my peers and I realized that it was challenging to translate the material learned from classes into the laboratory. While courses often focus on already-discovered processes and mechanisms, science in the real world (not just in the laboratory) requires creative thinking and critical analysis. Powerhouse teaches the stories of famous biological discoveries to help students expand their view of science. Videos are created and animated by Harrison Ngue, student at Harvard University.

Primitive Technology
@primitivetechnology9550•11m subscribers
Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber. FAQ Q.Where is this? A.This is in Far North Queensland Australia. Q.Do you live in the wild? A.I don't live in the wild but just go into the bush to make these projects. Also I camp out here occasionally. Q.How did you learn all this? A.Researching books and internet plus trial and error. I'm not indigenous and have no army training. Check out my blog below.

And it will leave you more inspired and motivated to go practice. I’ll be your host for most of the videos, but there will be other instructors that will appear on this channel as well.

I have made it my mission to restore it. My theology is Reformed/Calvinist, but I am very ecumenical and open to learning from other Christian traditions. I am a regular gen Z (zoomer) who was raised in a very secular progressive culture. I was once a leftist, but came to know Christ as a teenager which alienated me from my community. I've dedicated all my life since then to learning the things of God and finding creative ways to share what I know with others.

Scott Manley is someone who fell into YouTube because he felt a deep compelling need to teach people orbital mechanics and rocket science so they could play Kerbal Space Program, now, years later the gaming videos are less important and the pure science is the main thrust. My degrees are all in Physics and Astronomy, so much of the rocket science and engineering I've learned is self taught, always learning, always teaching. I used to do this as a hobby, along with my day job in software development, but that recently came to an end and I'm really appreciating everyone who has chosen to support my work through Patreon.

Steve Builds Websites
@stevebuildswebsites•84.9k subscribers
I got interested in website tools after I launched my own — and failed. In 2012, I launched a website builder but soon realized the market was already crowded with competitors. Rather than adding yet-another website builder, I saw a need to help people navigate the existing website builders and find the best ones. That insight led me to create Site Builder Report in 2013, where I began reviewing website builders. In 2017, I added a YouTube channel called Steve Builds Websites. And while I still continue to write at Site Builder Report, my real passion has shifted towards creating videos for Steve Builds Websites.

As a kid, I was always fascinated by technology. To my luck, nothing changed over these years. From following Steve Jobs in the early days to seeing google taking over cloud computing to the next level. Playing Galaxy with my Atari computer or now playing the latest games on Xbox, I have fed my curiosity enough to have finally decided to share all this back with people around me. The key focus is to do quality work on YouTube and help in generating the same curiosity. Professionally I am a trainer, hence most videos are more educational in nature. Will try and keep it fun!

Hi there. My name is Jochem. I make the show The Present Past, a show where I research how the present has been influenced by the past. History but connected to the present and fun! Every episode I show how history has influenced and made a thing, an idea or event in our present time. Let me know if you have a topic you'd like to share! Even though I actually have been educated as a historian and do my research, I can and will make mistakes. So don't take the word of a youtube historian as the absolute end-all truth.

@thethoughtemporium•2.17m subscribers
Science is a bottomless well of some of the most amazing things this universe has to offer. There is so much amazing science and engineering that gets done, but most often the only ones who get to experience it first hand are those in expensive labs in universities. This channel aims to explore as much of fields of science and engineering as possible by showing real experiments and research being done in a fun and accessible way. While the goal is to show that even very hard science can be done in a DIY way, some projects will use some of the fancier toys that while less accessible, opens a broader range of projects that can be done. We cover everything from genetic engineering and tissue culture, to nuclear physics, to machine engineering, to chemical synthesis and more.

Visual X
@VisualXAnimation•5.66k subscribers
Visual X soll vor allem eines bewirken - mehr Vorstellungsvermögen in euren Köpfen generieren. Die letzten Jahre als Mathe- und Physiklehrer haben mich gelehrt, dass es bei Schülern meistens nicht an der ganzen Rechnerei scheitert... Viele Schülerinnen und Schüler finden kaum den richtigen Ansatz zur Lösung eines Problems. Um genau diesen Knoten platzen zu lassen, lege ich den Fokus in meinen Videos mehr auf die Visualisierung als auf den rechnerischen Aspekt. Selbstverständlich sind in allen Videos aber kleine Übungen integriert. Je nachdem wie viel Zeit ich neben meinem Job zum Programmieren und Schneiden der Videos aufbringen kann, werden hier also in regelmäßigen Abständen Videos hochgeladen. Ehre, wem Ehre gebürt: Die Animationen habe ich mit Manim erstellt, einer open source python library, die von Grant Sanderson entwickelt wurde. Hier sein Kanal: https://www.youtube.com/3blue1brown Viel Spaß und willkommen bei Visual X Martin

What If
@whatifscienceshow•8.83m subscribers
An epic exploration of possibilities. Join Peter and explore science-based hypothetical worlds across space, technology, Earth, and prehistoric history. Each episode begins with a simple “what if” question and follows real scientific theory, physics, biology, and astronomy to see where those ideas could lead. Travel from deep space and alien planets to future technology and ancient life on Earth, and discover how small changes in science or history could reshape life, civilization, and the universe. It’s a blend of science education, imagination, and real research that helps you see our world, and the cosmos, from a fresh perspective.

Wild Mathing
@WildMathing•375k subscribers
Математика, на мой взгляд — один из видов искусства, и в большинстве роликов последних лет стараюсь это отразить. Возможно, вы сможете лучше понять этот язык науки, если посмотрите на визуализацию классических теорем, узнаете о жизни великих ученых. Еще на канале вы найдете геометрические интерпретации и красивые задачи. Многие сюжеты родились из классических книг, «Геометрии в картинках» А. Акопяна и журнала «Квант». Анимации сделаны с помощью библиотеки Manim. «За чистую математику! Да не найдет она никаких приложений!»

Yo! My name is Sean but I go by Zoro online. I'm an AI & no-code enthusiast focused on helping founders spread their voice (and products) through automated content systems. I've driven over 7-Figures in sales for B2B founders in December 2024 alone with personal branding and content systems. I truly believe that the greatest opportunities of our lifetime are going to be found in the crossroads between creatives and technology (Artificial Intelligence). I believe that AI doesn't serve as a replacement for creators but rather a tool that can be used to amplify them, giving people more time to focus on the true creative aspects they love while being able to produce triple the content without sacrificing any of the quality or authenticity that comes along with that. I'm focused on documenting all of my findings for you and giving you first hand advice on leveraging this amazing technology to grow your own personal brand. So... subscribe ;)

Best Academic and Admission Care in Bangladesh. “উদ্ভাস-উন্মেষ” প্রচলিত শাব্দিক প্রয়োগে এডমিশন কেয়ার হলেও এটি মূলত স্বপ্নদর্শী একদল মানুষের আলোদয়ী প্ল্যাটফর্ম। যাঁরা মুখস্থ বিদ্যার অন্ধচর্চাকে মাড়িয়ে রোজ স্বপ্ন দেখে সৃজনশীলতার। যাঁরা বিশ্বাস করে শিক্ষার মূল লক্ষ্য প্রতিটি মানুষের সুপ্ত প্রতিভাকে বিকশিত করা, চিন্তাশক্তিকে শাণিত করা, মূল্যবোধ তৈরি করা কিংবা প্রতিটি মানুষকে আত্মবিশ্বাসী, ধৈর্যশীল ও দায়িত্ববান মানুষ হিসেবে গড়ে তোলা। আর এই লক্ষ্যেই ‘উদ্ভাস-উন্মেষ শিক্ষা পরিবার’ সহায়ক বন্ধু হিসেবে কাজ করে যাচ্ছে সকল শিক্ষার্থীর জন্য। কারণ “উদ্ভাস-উন্মেষ শিক্ষা পরিবার” বরাবর-ই চায় শিক্ষার্থীরা একটি প্রশ্নের সম্পূর্ণ সঠিক উত্তর করার আগে সেটা সম্পর্কে সঠিক ধারণা রাখুক, স্বপ্নপূরণের পথে হোঁচট খেয়ে থেমে না থেকে জয়ের স্বপ্নে সর্বদা বিভোর থাকুক এবং একজন শিক্ষার্থী ভালো ছাত্র-ছাত্রী হওয়ার পূর্বে একজন ভালো মানুষ হয়ে উঠুক।
